Currently 40% electricity in the UK is generated from carbon intensive sources [2], and electricity demand is expect to increase by a factor 3 to 4 as heating and transport energy usage are decarbonized via electrification [3]. As a result, around 100 GW of wind and 60 GW of solar generation need to be constructed by 2050 [3]. However, managing the variability of electricity generation from these renewable sources to maintain security of supply presents a significant challenge [4], and the required adaptation of the energy system will be costly. Grid-scale energy storage is expected to be the main mechanism for matching renewable electricity supply with demand. Co-locating bulk energy storage with renewable generation and industrial loads, referred to as an energy park, has been proposed as a way of both improving the profitability of grid-scale storage (reducing the cost of its services), and reducing the grid impact of variable renewable generation [5, 6].

Across the literature, estimates of technical parameters (e.g. round-trip efficiency and self-discharge rate) and economic parameters (e.g. cost per energy capacity and service lifetime) vary over wide ranges [7–11]. For example, a literature review, [8], found estimates for Sodium-Sulphur high-temperature batteries ranging from 70–90% for round-trip efficiency, and 0–20% for self-discharge rate. An IRENA report, [7], estimated the annualized energy capacity cost of compressed-air storage to be between 2 and 355 cents/kWh/yr. ",

[16] consider the sizing of wind generation, battery storage, and electrolyzer capacity in a micro-grid with local demands for both electricity and hydrogen. A bi-level optimization method is used to minimize the average cost of meeting the local energy demands, accounting for uncertainty in wind generation and demand patterns on operating costs, and uncertainty in the per capacity costs of the assets. Gabrielli et al. [17] develop a method for sizing a multi-energy system with solar generation, battery storage, heat pumps, and an electrolyzer, so that the design is robust to uncertainty in weather conditions and the electricity and heating demands which must be met.

Section 3 describes the illustrative energy park studied, including the probabilistic models of renewable generation, industrial load, and energy storage technology performance uncertainty used, and the Stochastic Programming model used to perform system design. Section 4 presents the results of the numerical experiments and discusses their importance for informing energy park design practices. An initial experiment quantifies the value of being able to adjust the energy park design, and choice of energy storage technology, after uncertainty in storage technology performance has been reduced by R&D. However, as no information is available in the literature regarding how much R&D might reduce uncertainty, i.e. how closely the performance of a demonstrator system matches a large-scale version, a sensitivity analysis over the level of uncertainty reduction is performed. The value of optionality is then investigated in two further cases where two energy storage technologies are used in the park, and where risk aversion is incorporated into the design process. Finally conclusions are drawn in Section 5. ",

This system is modelled on a real-world energy park proposal. Due to its importance for decarbonizing transportation, heavy industry, and chemical manufacturing, there has been substantial commercial interest in the production of low-carbon hydrogen at scale. A proposal to build a 250 MW hydrogen electrolyser facility in the Port of Rotterdam to decarbonize industry and transportation in the area has received early-stage support from the Dutch government [37, 38]. Co-locating renewable generation and energy storage with this industrial hydrogen plant in an energy park would reduce the total cost of operating the system, and its impact on the electricity grid.

It is assumed that offshore wind and solar generation (via direct wire connection) can be installed to support the site, and that energy can be traded with the grid. Fig. 2 illustrates the energy flows within the system model. Limits are imposed on grid connection capacity to reflect network restrictions, and on the maximum solar generation capacity to reflect land scarcity. Additionally, a capital budget constraint is imposed. Optimization-based design is used to select the energy storage technology and generation & storage sizings that minimize the expected cost of providing the plant load. A carbon price is included to reflect the incentives for low-carbon hydrogen production. Uncertainties in the industrial load, patterns of wind and solar generation, and cost and technical performance of the different storage technologies are accounted for during design. ",

In an initial design stage, an energy storage technology is selected, and approximate sizings of the wind, solar, and storage capacities are determined (for consenting, planning permission, and procurement). At the time of initial design, the expected performance of each storage technology during operation is uncertain. As project planning and the pre-construction phases are completed, it is assumed that procurement and R&D is undertaken for the chosen storage technology, leading to the creation of a small-scale demonstrator. This demonstrator storage system provides the energy park designer with measurements of the storage technology performance, which reduce uncertainty in the actual performance of a large-scale system. However, performing this procurement and R&D to reduce storage uncertainty is costly. After the demonstrator project is complete, a final design stage selects the exact wind, solar, and storage capacities for the energy park system. Finally, the system is constructed and operated, and the overall cost of providing the industrial load is observed. This decision model is illustrated in Fig. 3. ",
